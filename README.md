This repository showcases my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. From Project 1, I submitted the files for the Appointment Service, Contact Service, and Task Service. These files demonstrate my ability to create and implement unit tests to uncover errors and ensure functionality. From Project Two, I submitted the summary and reflections report, which highlights my understanding of various software testing approaches and the application of appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements.

Reflection
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is both functional and secure, I focus on thorough testing and validation throughout the development process. By writing comprehensive unit tests, such as those in ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java, I can verify that each component of the software works as intended. Additionally, by employing security best practices, like input validation and error handling, I mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews and security audits are also essential to identify and address any security issues early.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs involves actively engaging with the requirements provided and transforming them into actionable tasks within the software development process. I achieved this by thoroughly analyzing the requirements to ensure a clear understanding of what the user expects. In the contact service project, for example, I incorporated user needs by ensuring that the program met specific constraints such as unique contact IDs and valid input lengths, which align with user expectations for data integrity and usability.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software begins with understanding the requirements and planning the overall architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. I prioritize modularity, creating small, reusable components that can be easily tested and updated. For the contact service, this meant designing separate classes for data handling and service logic (Contact.java and ContactService.java) to keep the code organized and maintainable. I also consider the future needs of the application and aim to design with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy updates and integration of new features.
